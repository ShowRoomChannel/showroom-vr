Showroom-VR
=====

A room-scale virtual reality environment for the HTC Vive that can allow players to see and interact with a wide variety of 3D models on four interconnected showroom platforms.

The level can be lightly modified to work well in mobile and web environments.

This environment has been used successfully to showcase agency work and for ideation with the following models:
- Nissan Rogue 2017
- Case-IH Magnum
- Intel Drone
- Tesla Model 3

Note that these models are not included in the project. Use this environment to showcase your own models.

## Requirements

- [x] [Unity 2017 or higher](https://unity3d.com/)
- [x] [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/)

## Controls

Hold the trackpad down on either the right or left Vive controller, point at the floor to highlight where you would like to move, then release the trackpad to teleport.

## Environment

The environment sports a cloverleaf design with four interconnected showcase platforms.

Props such as signage, screens, and tablets are included. A common area in the middle with furniture is included.

The four showroom platforms are:
- **Alpha** (red)
- **Beta** (blue)
- **Charlie** (green)
- **Delta** (yellow)

You can customize the showrooms with your own colors. Using the main albedo of the featured model for the background color makes for a neat ambient effect in each showroom.

The level design was inspired by [2001 Space Odyssey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/) and [Grupo Irizar](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dupont-corian-shapes-new-futuristic-headquarter-showroom-greco/).

## Mobile & Web Support

The cloverleaf design of the environment allows you to break apart the level and use a single showroom for a mobile experience with the Gear VR, Google Daydream, or Google Cardboard.

It can also be used on the web and with web VR frameworks like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) because it is low poly.

## Future Plans

If you find this environment helpful, please let me know.

Future additions may include:
- Updated level design with a new aesthetic
- Large hangar area for larger models like commercial airline jets and combine harvesters
- Interactive robot assistant
- Helper code for interactivity and model configurators
